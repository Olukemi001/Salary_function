This project includes Python and R scripts for managing employee data. The Python scripts allow users to retrieve employee details from a CSV file, export the data into a ZIP archive, and handle errors gracefully. The R script extracts and displays the contents of the ZIP archive. These tools streamline employee data management and visualization.
